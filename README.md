Official website: https://wordpress.org/plugins/improved-save-button/

This plugin adds a new and improved “Save” button to the Post Edit screen that, in a single click, saves the current post and immediately takes you to your next action.

(WordPress 5 info: see below for particularities for WordPress 5.)

## The following actions are available:


* **Save and New**: in a single click, saves the current post and goes to New Post Screen.
* **Save and Duplicate**: saves the post, duplicates it and goes to this new post’s Edit Screen.
* **Save and List** (a.k.a. Save and Close): saves the post and goes to the Posts List.
* **Save and Return**: saves the post and returns you to the page where you were just before (no matter which page).
* **Save and Next**: saves the post and goes to the next post’s Edit Screen.
* **Save and Previous**: saves the post and goes to the previous post’s Edit Screen.
* **Save and View** (same or new window): saves the post and goes to the post’s frontend page. Can show the post in the same window or in a new one.

This plugin saves you a lot of time when you have multiple posts, pages or custom posts to create or modify!

Works with pages, posts and custom post types!

Through the plugin’s settings page, you can choose which actions to show and which one to use as the button’s default action.

## WordPress 5 info
The plugin technically works with WordPress 5, but it doesn’t work with the new Gutenberg editor, which is the default editor for WordPress 5. You have to disable the Gutenberg editor to use this plugin.
