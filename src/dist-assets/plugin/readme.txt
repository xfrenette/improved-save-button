Adds a button to the Edit Post screen which, in one click, saves the post and redirects you to the posts list, the New Post form or an adjacent post.

== Description ==

Save a lot of time with this plugin if you have multiple posts, pages or custom posts to create or modify!

This plugin adds a new "Save" button to the Post Edit screen that, in one click, saves the current post and immediately redirects you to either the posts list, the New Post screen or the Post Edit screen of the previous or next post.

The new button adds the following possibilities:

* **Save and List** (a.k.a. Save and Close): in one click, save the current post and go back to the posts list.
* **Save and New**: in one click, save the current post and go to the New Post screen.
* **Save and Previous**: in one click, save the current post and go to the previous post's Edit screen.
* **Save and Next**: in one click, save the current post and go to the next post's Edit screen.

Works with pages, posts and custom post types!

Through the plugin's settings page, choose which actions are available and which one to use as the buttons' default action.
