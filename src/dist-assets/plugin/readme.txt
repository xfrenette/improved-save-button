== Description ==

Having multiple posts, pages or custom posts to create or modify? Tired of having to first save the current post, wait for the page to reload and then click on "All posts" or "Add new post"?

This plugins adds an improved "Save" button to the Edit Post screen which saves the current post and immediately get you to
either the posts list, the New Post form or to the next or previous post's edit screen.

You can now :

- Save and New : in one click, save the current post and go to the New Post form
